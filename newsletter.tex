\subsection*{\sffamily Featured Plant: Dendrophylax}
Dendrophylax is a genus of epiphytic neotropical orchids found throughout Mexico, Central America, The West Indies, and Florida. This genus is notable as, while seedlings may produce a low number of tiny leaves, the mature plants of many species have evolved to be leafless-instead possessing densely clustered photosynthetic roots that contain chlorophyll in addition to absorbing water and nutrients. One such species-Dendrophylax lindenii (the ghost orchid)-is found growing epiphytally on trees in swampy forests of southwest Florida, Cuba, and other Caribbean islands, and blooms a number of impressive pale white flowers between June and August.\quoted{Jacques, Discord (11/23/2022)}

\subsection*{\sffamily Featured Botanist : Gregor Mendel}
Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, is known as the father of modern genetics for his groundbreaking research on the heredity of traits in pea plants. He discovered the basic principles of inheritance, including dominant and recessive traits, which are still used by scientists today to study genetics in plants and animals. Mendel's work had a significant impact on botany, showing horticulturalists how they can selectively breed plants with desirable traits. Despite being largely ignored in his time, Mendel is now recognized as one whose contributions to botany and genetics continue to shape our understanding of the natural world.\quoted{Alex, Direct Submission (03/13/2023)}
